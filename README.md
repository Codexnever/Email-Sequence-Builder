## üéÆ How to Use

### Creating an Email Sequence

1. Register or log in to your account
2. Click "Create New Sequence" on the dashboard
3. Drag nodes from the sidebar onto the canvas:
   - **Cold Email**: For composing email content
   - **Wait/Delay**: For adding time delays between emails
   - **Lead Source**: For segmenting your audience
4. Connect the nodes by dragging from one node's handle to another
5. Configure each node by filling in the required information:
   - For Email nodes: recipient, subject, and body
   - For Delay nodes: time duration and unit (minutes, hours, days)
   - For Lead Source nodes: source type
6. Click "Save Flow" to save your sequence and schedule the emails

### Example Sequence

A simple follow-up sequence might look like:
1. Initial Cold Email ‚Üí Wait 2 Days ‚Üí Follow-up Email
2. If using Lead Source: Website Lead ‚Üí Cold Email ‚Üí Wait 1 Day ‚Üí Follow-up
